    <p> Stray is on a whole different level. It's a single-player adventure game where I play as a stray cat in a cyberpunk city. The world is run by the robots, and the city is aesthetic, dark, and mesmerizing. The main mission is to find our way back home, but along the way, there's a lot of mystery to uncover.<br>The graphics are surprisingly very stunning and HDs. I found the storyline very emotional and memorable. This game isn't just about the gameplay, it's about the experience itself. I love every second of it. Sometimes I would just stop and stare at the scenery because it's amazing.<br>If you are looking for something chill but very deep, Stray is unforgettable.</p>
